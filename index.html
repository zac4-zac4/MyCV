        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I’m an aspiring full-stack web developer currently completing a Full
          Stack Web Development bootcamp with HyperionDev. I’m at the early
          stages of my journey, building my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          Git, and back-end fundamentals. I enjoy understanding how websites
          work from the ground up and seeing my progress turn into real,
          functioning projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I’m still learning, I’ve already built several small static
          sites and interactive components, and I’m steadily improving my
          confidence with development tools and workflows. Outside of coding,
          I’m passionate about football and spend most weekends either playing
          or watching matches. I’m also really interested in digital design
          psychology — especially how small visual decisions influence the way
          people interact with a page.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to develop into a capable full-stack developer who can
          create clean, responsive, user-focused web applications. I’m motivated
          by continuous learning, solving problems, and the idea of building
          things that genuinely help people. As I work through my course and
          build more projects, I’m aiming to grow a strong portfolio and start
          my career in the tech industry.
